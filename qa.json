      "question": "Please summarize the video",
      "answer": "The video is a first impressions review of The Last of Us Part 1 on PC. The reviewer, Jake, expresses disappointment with the game's performance issues on PC, despite it being a beloved and highly anticipated title. Many players have reported problems such as stuttering, crashes, and long load times, even on high-end systems. The game also has some strange default settings and issues with compiling shaders.\n\nJake mentions that the PC version could have been the definitive version of the game, with its in-depth display and graphical options. However, the poor optimization and widespread issues make it hard to recommend at this time. He advises potential buyers to wait for patches and updates before purchasing the game, and to research other reviews and experiences before making a decision.\n\nDespite the issues, Jake still praises the game itself, highlighting its memorable moments, characters, and gameplay. He hopes that the PC community will eventually be able to enjoy and mod the game once the performance issues are resolved."

It helps us by answering questions, writing stories, and giving ideas. It's not perfect, but it's getting better, and one day it might be really important, just like computers are important now."
